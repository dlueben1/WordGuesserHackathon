# Word Guesser (Hackathon Project 2021)

This is a recreation of the classic game "Hangman". I made this as my midterm project for UMBC's Software Developer Foundations Course.

## Playing the Game

To play the game, type in a guess. You only have three strikes before you lose, so guess carefully! Good luck!

## Concepts Used

I used Custom Functions, Lists, and String Searching to bring this project to life.
